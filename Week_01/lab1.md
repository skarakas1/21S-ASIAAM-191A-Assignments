For my user-created field I chose to create a field showing the percentage of 'other' responses by county.
I chose this field because the category 'other' is problematic for a few reasons. It is essentially an erasure, it is uninformative and non-specific. Rather than letting respondents write-in custom responses it groups everyone who does not identify as either "white, black, asian, pacific islander, mixed."
These groupings conflate race and ethnicity and reproduce simplistic racial categorizations that erase the complexities of identity and racial politics in the US. In this dataset there is no option for indigenous, which in itself is a generalized category. Having data on who identified as indigenous would not illustrate the spatial patterns of different indigenous groups like Tongva or Kumeyaay. The oversimplification/generalization of this dataset effectively erases specific and complex identities.
